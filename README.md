This project focuses on binary classification using two famous data sets : Banknote Authentication and Chronic Kidney Disease.
The purpose is to build a library in which all the functions to perform preprocessing and processing are gathered ("workflow.py").
We then use a jupyter notebook (tests.pynb") which calls the functions of this library to carry out the classification and plot the various results obtained.
We used several binary classification algorithms and a neural network. Additionally, we look at different feature selection methods in order to reduce dimensionality.
